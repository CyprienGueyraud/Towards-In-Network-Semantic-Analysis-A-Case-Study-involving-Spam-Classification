allWordsAdd.p4 , allWordsCheck.p4, and registerHeader.p4 are files used to change the sample of words analysed. They DO NOT need to be modified alone : the file printWords.py is used to do it.

creator.py and CreatorMail.py are just script that help writing other files, and they are not supposed to be usefull after that.

v01.p4 is the main p4 program : modification for the program are in this one most of the time.

Makefile and run_v01.sh are files used for the run of the algorithm. The makefile can be modified if you change names of files and directories.

sendmail.py is the script used to send a sample of emails to the p4 program

Register.py is a script used to read registers of the p4 program
