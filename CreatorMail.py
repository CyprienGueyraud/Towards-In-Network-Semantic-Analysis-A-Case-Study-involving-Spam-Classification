coast ( retired brigadier general robert guei ) who was assasinated in a political crisis which led to war in my country ( ivory - coast ) on 19 th september , 2002 . my father , mother and two junior brothers were killed by some soldiers believed to be loyal to the government because of my father ' s objection to some certain policies of the present government . i was lucky to have escaped with a brother who is the last child of the family that night because we were visiting a family friend in another city far away from our home .\ni have to go into hiding with my junior brother for some days before arrangements were made for us to leave ivory - coast for the republic of togo on the invitation of president eyadema of togo who granted us political assylum .\nbefore we left for togo , i visited our home where my mother and my two junior ones were killed in our village and during the search for some documents in my father ' s room came accross some vital documents and the keys to a secret vault in the house . i took the keys and went down to where the vault is and there i discovered two metal boxes which were carefully hidden . with the aide of the documents i was able to open the boxes only to find out that the boxes were full of money in hundred dollar bills . i could not count the money because i was very shock to see it and again it is too much for me to count but the documents that i discovered in his room which led me to the boxes put the money at $ 10 , 000 , 000 ( ten million usd ) .\ni locked it back carefully and arranged for the boxes to be moved with me through the help of some family friends to abidjan the capital city where i deposited it with a security company for safe - keeping . i did not declare the content of boxes to the security company , i only declare it as family valuables .\nwhen the african leaders came to ivory - coast and president eyadema invited us to go to the republic of togo where i now live with my junior one .\ni cannot touch the money and even afraid to tell it to our family friends who have been coming to visit us in togo . i decided that it will be better to move the money abroad where i can put to safe and have it invested . this has been my reason for contacting you .\ni would have given you my telephone number so that you can call me in order to discuss the issue better but i ' m afraid to do so because we have too many people around us who i would not want to know of the money . it will be better for me to communicate through internet until we can make proper and solid arrangements about how to move the money .\ni wish to meet with you if you can make a trip to the republic of togo or ivory - coast , then we can meet secretly before we go ahead for the transaction . i am ready to offer 20 % of the money to you for this assistance . it is not that i am paying you but for your assistance which i shall really appreciate .\nplease i wish that this assistance be treated highly confidential .\nwaiting to read your response about the proposal soonext .\nprivate mail : gasarahl 25 @ netscape . net\nthanks ,\nsarah guei .\n", 'Subject: small cap stox can sizzle\nthe contact center industry\nfew people today know exactly what a contact center does . its predecessor , the call center , brings to mind large telemarketing operations with people calling your house during dinner time . but the fact is that the contact center is much more than that .\nwe see 800 numbers everywhere - the back of our credit cards , the fast food drive - thru window , i \' ll bet even your bottle of water has a phone number to call with questions . the fact is that wherever there is an 800 number , there is a person answering the call . not just a person , but millions of people in north america alone , across a staggering 76 , 000 + contact centers .\nit used to be the contact center only handled inbound customer service calls and outbound sales calls . that was before the proliferation of the internet - now these same customer service reps are waiting for our phone calls , our faxes , our emails and our web chats . we can call from our offices , home phones , cell phones - even from our computers - americans generate hundreds of millions of transactions each year for contact centers and the industry has grown by leaps and bounds . so aggressive is the growth that today , we are as likely to get someone in california to answer our call as we are to get someone in india .\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\ncontact centers in north america handle millions of transactions each year . for each type of transaction there is a technology that supports it . automatic call distributors for inbound calls , interactive voice response systems ( the dreaded " press 1 " ) for self service , email and web servers . in the midst of all of this disparate technology , contact centers began to lose track of a very important piece of their puzzle : information .\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\nthe contact center industry is one of the most data intensive industries . think about it - even if you order a pair of shoes , the contact center has your name , phone number , mailing address , billing address , credit card information , etc . the contact center also has information on each and every one of their employees and all of their activity . every call they received , how long they talked , how long they placed people on hold , how many calls were transferred . until now , no single piece of technology can track information on all people regarding all activities , for one simple reason . the activities are all generated and tracked by different technologies .\nhuman science systems , inc .\n( hmns )\ncompany overview :\nhuman science systems , inc . ( pink sheets : hmns ) is a contact center software development firm . its flagship product , central authorityt serves one main purpose : to be a single point of contact for all data generated in the contact center . central authorityt can track and disseminate all data generated in the contact center , regardless of the technology where the data originated .\ncentral authorityt is a contact center resource management ( ccrmt ) product . ccrm is the act of managing data regarding all human , physical and technical resources within the contact center . contact center resources can all be categorized under four distinct umbrellas : employees , technology , capacity , and clients . it may be hard to believe , but the reality is that all functions within the contact center fall under one of those four categories , and our company has come up with a method and a technology that allows departments to easily exchange and leverage valuable data on a real - time basis . "\n* why hmns should be on your radar :\n1 . datamonitor states that the us contact center market reached a volume of 76 , 000 contact centers in 2001 and that by the end of 2006 that number will exceed 79 , 600 contact centers .\n2 . contact center reporting and data tracking has always been burdensome , more so with the incorporation of the various technologies required to successfully compete in the industry .\n3 . today \' s contact center requires a responsiveness that can only be achieved with timely and accurate insight into business conditions , but this is not easily accomplished in the absence of methods and technology to easily collect data from numerous disparate sources .\n4 . contact centers are looking to replace manual or semi - automated methods of data collection and dissemination because they are not only burdensome , but highly inaccurate and complex .\n5 . hmns principals have an established track record as industry experts going back over 15 years and have high level contacts in all of the top tier contact centers . top tier contact centers generate over $ 100 million per year within the north american market .\n6 . hmns has patentable methods and technologies and recently retained a well known technology patent attorney to process its applications for the protection of its intellectual property .\n7 . a recent report by empire research associates stated that the company could achieve rapid market share penetration in the contact center industry market segment and that a 5 % market share level in five years would be plausible . with a mere 5 % market share , a 40 % sales margin ( fully taxed ) would imply $ 10 million of net income in 2010 . in that event , the report noted that on the present 17 . 6 million shares , earnings would exceed $ 0 . 50 per share . the report concluded that " the target market is large and enticing to hmns and we believe the company \' s product has a good chance of hitting it ! "\n8 . the company is negotiating distributorships through software distributors that currently generate billions of dollars in revenue from the center industry .\n9 . hmns will generate revenue not only from software sales , but from application service provider ( asp ) services ( from customers that " subscribe " to the technology and access it by the internet ) , from installation ( billable at 12 % of the total software sale ) , and recurring maintenance ( recurring annual revenue billable at 18 % of the value of the software ) .\n10 . datamonitor recently estimated the global market for call center component technologies at $ 4 . 1 billion , and predicts an increase to $ 5 . 5 billion by 2007 , growing at a 6 . 0 % compounded annual growth rate .\n11 . gartner also reports positive and stable growth for software distributors , stating that end user spending was to exceed $ 76 . 1 billion by the end of 2005 .\n12 . last year alone , u . s . banks were forecasted to spend $ 1 . 9 billion on contact center technology .\n* management and other comments :\nlou mandic , hmns ceo & president : " this technology was born out of years worth of research . we are well engrained in this industry and are keenly aware of its needs . we are without a doubt delivering the most mission critical software in the industry today . we anticipate rapid growth , which is not uncommon in our industry . by its fourth year of operation , blue pumpkin - a company that provides only a portion of what central authority offers - had already captured a 7 % market share . a far lesser market share will have our company earning better than $ 10 million annually . "\ncompany philosophy :\n" if you can measure it you can manage it . "\n* things to consider :\naccording to empire research , the company has a competitively superior product , a large enough market to support sustained rapid growth , and a proprietary market position that can provide handsome profit returns .\nhmns is in the process of establishing distributorships with companies that annually sell billions of dollars worth of software to contact centers .\nhmns has buy - out appeal and has already been approached by far larger players that may later be interested in acquiring the company and / or its intellectual property .\nhow the technology works\ncentral authorityt is a software product that fills the role of a central repository of data . through meta data tables , the software is able to " read " all other technologies , and act as a central point of contact for the enterprise . the software also collects data inherently ( this is data entered directly into central authorityt , not collected from other systems ) on employees , recruiting sources and performance , enabling the organization to better manage its human resource processes and reducing its turnover , which can be as high as 200 % in the contact center industry .\n* conclusion :\nthe problem with inter - departmental communications is not exclusive to the contact center industry . it is a problem for corporate america as a whole . companies like human science systems are delivering the next mission critical piece of software - one that can normalize all data , across all technologies , and act as a single , central point of contact for the enterprise .', 'Subject: - get a dell laptop computer free !\n', 'Subject: filled norton , macromedia ; xp pro ( sp 2 ) , acrobat . ms office 2 oo 3 , adobe photoshop similar sugar anything\npurpose benefit parents leader carefully goes ,\nmost popular softwwares start from $ 20 a\nwindows xp pro ( sp 2 )\nmicrosoft office 2003 system pro ( 5 cds ) w\nadobe photoshop cs 8 . 0\nadobe acrobat 7 . 0 professional\nautocad 2006\nsymantec norton systemworks 2 oo 5 x\ndvdxcopy platinum 4 . 0 . 38\nquickbooks 2004 premier edition\nmacromedia studio mx 2004\nmicrosoft office system professional 2003\nnorton antivirus 2005\nadobe pagemaker 7 . 01 & many many morewanted we order ur softwares here servants\nrich drew how anything .\n', 'Subject: 82 % off for all new software . imports dearths\nbehaved strengthened prospering contiguity submerge\nboredom deepened atypically stager quietest\nencouragements batting psychic footman wesson\nmauritania vest hurwitz courthouse\ncopying feeling budgetary allocated lusciousness\nbidders panoramic spoils\nwatchfulness audiometer sportswriting injected\nregistration madeira natal\nslopes gabrielle traditionally moderately rickety\n', "Subject: discount generic drugs\ndo you need pharmaceuticals ?\nget them here from reliable canadian pharmacy .\nso don ' t wait any\nlonger !\nit is your unique chance to save on medications up to\n90 % ! confidentiality guaranteed , super fast ordering , and fast world wide\nshipping .\nit is not just about saving . it is about boosting\nyour health .\nwe carry just about any pharmaceuticals you could\npossibly need so don ' t miss your chance .\ntutorial inexplainable beet\n", "Subject: bait apologue ' s vacation\nthinking about a vacation in mexico ?\ncome to the ajijic guest house .\n20 dollars a night rate , if you say you saw this ad !\nemail : info @ ajijicguesthouse . com\nphone : ( from the u . s . and canada ( 001 + 52 ) )\n( 376 ) 766 - 2149 ( 9 am - 9 pm cst )\nlocation : ajijic guest house\nindependencia # 11\najijic , jalisco , mexico cp 45920\n6172968 a 8487 f 32 ebl 9 b\n", 'Subject: 25 mg did thee trick\nhow to save on your medlcatlons over sixshooter 60 % .\npharm auscultate amail shop - s viniculture uccessfull and proven way to save your mone advertize y .\ninevitable \\\na nodular g\naffair l\nl browned u\nvesper / l\nr bourse a counterscarp cla\ni cornucopia sv winterize al\nnailing m\nandmanyother .\n* best p inartificial rlces\n* worldwide sh foolishness lpplng\n* to unvote tal confidentiaiity\n* over 5 mili airspraying ion customers\nhave a ni snuffy ce day !', 'Subject: find your fortune in real estate\nwant to be dropped from our list ?
